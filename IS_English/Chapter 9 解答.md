> From our earliest days, we human beings have fought with one another in many of our disputes. We have used weapons that have become more sophisticated over time. All though many of our weapons are very effective, there have been some weapons that have failed to live up to expectations. Today, we look at two such failed weapons programs.
>
> In 1874, Russian designers finished building a ship that they felt would be perfect for defending the coastal waters of Russia. The name of the ship was Novgarat, and it had a very unusual design. Unlike a regular ship, the Navgarat was circular. It was believed that this circular design would allow the ship to carry much larger guns because of the increased stability. Although the Novgrot could carry very large guns, its shortcomings outweighed any of its advantages. Owing to the circular design, the ship was extremely slow in battle. Also, it was not as stable as had been thought. However, the most serious weakness became clear whenever it fired one of its guns. Since the guns were not located in the center of the ship, when one of them was fired, the ship would start to spin like a top. This spinning took a considerable amount of time to stop and made the ship extremely ineffective in combat. It was taken out of active combat service and eventually scrapped in 1912.

> The second failed weapon program came from Nazi Germany during World War II. This weapon, called the Vindicanana, was an eleven meter long cannon that was 1 meter in diameter. An impressive looking weapon. The Vindicanana was not your normal cannon, however. Unlike a standard cannon which fired shells, the Vindicanana fired compressed air instead. The compressed air was created by the ignition of oxygen and hydrogen. It was thought that this weapon could be used to knock enemy aircraft out of the sky. In fact, during tests, it was shown that this weapon was capable of penetrating a 25 millimeter thick board of wood located over 200 meters away. Unfortunately, the aerodynamic design of fighter planes and their rapid speed and high altitude made this cannon a complete failure in the field. It was eventually stored in a test facility where it was discovered by allied troops in 1945.

> These two weapons were huge failures in terms of the resources and effort that were wasted in creating them. It is fairly certain that in the future there will be other failed and wasteful weapon programs.

> 我々人類は、生まれた時からお互いに争いを繰り広げてきました。そしてその過程で、私たちが使う武器は時間と共により洗練されてきました。しかし、中には期待に遠く及ばない武器も存在します。今日は、そういった失敗した二つの武器プログラムについて見ていきましょう。
>
> 1874年、ロシアの設計者たちはロシアの沿岸水域を防衛するための完璧な船を建造しました。その船の名前はノヴガラトで、非常にユニークな設計でした。通常の船とは違い、ノヴガラトは円形でした。この円形の設計は船により大きな安定性をもたらし、それによって大砲を多く搭載できると考えられました。しかし、ノヴガラトが大砲を多く搭載できたとはいえ、その欠点は利点を上回ってしました。円形の設計のせいで船は戦闘時に極度に遅く、また、思ったほど安定していませんでした。しかし、最も深刻な弱点は大砲を発射するたびに明らかとなりました。大砲が船の中心に位置していないため、一つを発射すると、船はコマのように回転し始めました。この回転が止まるまでにはかなりの時間がかかり、戦闘での効果を極めて低下させました。ノヴガラトは最終的に実戦から引退し、1912年に解体されました。
>
> 二つ目の失敗した武器プログラムは、第二次世界大戦中のナチス・ドイツからです。この武器、ヴィンディカナナと呼ばれるものは、長さ11メートル、直径1メートルの巨大な砲でした。見た目は非常に印象的でした。しかし、ヴィンディカナは通常の大砲とは違い、砲弾ではなく圧縮空気を発射しました。この圧縮空気は酸素と水素の燃焼により生成されました。この武器は敵の航空機を空から打ち落とすために使用されると考えられました。実際、試験ではこの武器が200メートル先の25ミリ厚の木板を貫通する能力があることが示されました。しかし、戦闘機の空気力学的な設計やその高速で高高度な飛行は、この大砲を実戦で完全に失敗させました。最終的には試験施設に保管され、1945年に連合軍によって発見されました。

> これら二つの武器は、それらを作り上げるために無駄にされたリソースや労力に関して、大きな失敗でした。将来も同様の失敗した、そして無駄な武器プログラムが存在することはほぼ確実でしょう。
