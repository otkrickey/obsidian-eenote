> In today's class, I'm going to introduce two famous American abolitionists. Interestingly enough, both of these abolitionists were themselves former slaves. Their names were frederick Douglas, Harriet Tubman.
>
> Frederick Douglas was born in Maryland sometime around 1818. The exact date of his birth is unknown since records were not kept by his owner. When he was around twelve years old, his owner's wife started to teach him the alphabet. His master, however, told her to stop teaching him because he said if Douglas learned how to read, he would want freedom. Douglas, however, continued to secretly teach himself to read and write. After several failed attempts, douglas finally was able to escape from his master when he was about 20 years old. From that point forward, he became an extremely active and influential abolitionist. He wrote numerous articles and gave countless speeches advocating freedom and equal right for slaves. In addition, he was a fervent believer in the importance of education. He felt that education was essential for African Americans to be able to improve their lives. Since schools for black children at that time were vastly inferior to those for white children, he promoted equal education facilities for black children. He was also an advocate for women's right to vote.
>
> Harriet Tubman's birth was also not recorded, but she was born in Maryland sometime around 1820. She had suffered years of abuse and hardship as a slave before her owner died in 1849. Since her owner's widow was planning to sell all of her slaves, tubman and her family were sure to be broken up. Tubman and two of her brothers therefore decided to escape. Although they returned for some unknown reason, tubman later escaped by herself and made it to Philadelphia. Upon reaching Philadelphia, she began working to help other slaves escape to the north. Tubman made numerous trips back into slave territory to help hundreds of people wishing to be free. Although there were many close calls, she was never captured during these journeys. She also served with the north during the US. Civil War. In fact, she was the first woman to lead a raid by Union troops that allowed approximately 700 slaves to escape by boat.
>
> Both Harriet Tubman and Frederick Douglas worked tirelessly to help slave s in the US. Today, they are recognized as heroes for the incredible efforts they made.

> 今日の授業では、二人の有名なアメリカの奴隷制度廃止運動家を紹介します。興味深いことに、この二人の廃止運動家は自身が元奴隷だったという共通点があります。彼らの名前はフレデリック・ダグラスとハリエット・タブマンです。
>
> フレデリック・ダグラスは1818年頃、メリーランド州で生まれました。彼の生年月日は正確には不明で、それは彼の所有者が記録を残していなかったからです。彼が12歳頃、所有者の妻が彼にアルファベットを教え始めました。しかし、その主人は彼に読み書きを教えることをやめさせました。なぜなら、ダグラスが読み書きを覚えると自由を求めるようになるだろうと考えたからです。しかしダグラスは、こっそりと自分で読み書きを続けました。幾度かの失敗を経て、20歳頃についに彼は主人から逃れることができました。その時点から彼は、非常に活動的で影響力のある廃止運動家となりました。彼は奴隷の自由と平等な権利を訴える多数の記事を書き、無数の演説を行いました。また、彼は教育の重要性を熱心に信じていました。彼は教育がアフリカ系アメリカ人が自分たちの生活を改善するために必要不可欠であると考えていました。当時、黒人の子どもたちのための学校は白人の子どもたちのための学校に比べて大きく劣っていたため、彼は黒人の子どもたちのための教育施設の平等化を推進しました。彼はまた、女性の投票権を支持していました。
>
> ハリエット・タブマンの生誕も記録されていませんが、彼女は1820年頃、メリーランド州で生まれました。彼女は1849年に所有者が亡くなるまで、奴隷としての虐待と苦難に耐えました。所有者の未亡人が全ての奴隷を売却する計画を立てていたため、タブマンと彼女の家族は間違いなく引き裂かれることになるでしょう。そこでタブマンと彼女の二人の兄弟は逃亡を決意しました。彼らは何らかの未知の理由で戻りましたが、タブマンは後に一人で逃亡し、フィラデルフィアにたどり着きました。フィラデルフィアに到着した彼女は、他の奴隷たちが北部に逃亡するのを手助けする作業を始めました。タブマンは何度も奴隷地域に戻り、数百人の自由を望む人々を助けました。これらの旅行で彼女が捕まったことは一度もありませんでした。また、彼女はアメリカ南北戦争中に北軍で務めました。実際、彼女は700人近くの奴隷が船で脱出するのを助ける連邦軍の襲撃を初めて指導した女性でした。

> ハリエット・タブマンとフレデリック・ダグラスは、アメリカの奴隷たちを助けるために絶えず努力しました。今日、彼らはその驚くべき努力のために英雄と認識されています。
