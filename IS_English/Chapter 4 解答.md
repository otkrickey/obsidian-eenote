> Today we are going to talk about a traditional Native American myth from the Inishnabeg people who came from the Great Lakes region of the US. And Canada. This story is called how the Fly Saved the river. A long, long time ago, there was a marvelous river that was filled with many fish. Since its water was pure and clean, many animals came from all around to drink from this wonderful river. Because of its reputation, a huge moose eventually learned about this amazing river and wanted to see it for himself. He was not disappointed. In fact, he loved the water so much that he decided to stay nearby and drink whenever he felt thirsty. Unfortunately, this moose was often very thirsty, so he drank from the river quite often. He drank so much that the level of the water started dropping. The other animals started to worry about what would happen if the moose continued to drink so much and so often.The beaver whose house was on the river, was afraid that if the water disappeared, his house would be destroyed. The muskrat who got his food from the river was afraid that he would starve if the river dried up naturally. The fish were the most frightened of all. They knew that if the river dried up, the other land animals could just move somewhere else, but they would die if the water disappeared. All of the animals got together to discuss what to do. They knew that they had to drive the moose away from the river. But he was much too big and powerful for them to accomplish this task. Even the bear was afraid of him. Finally, the fly spoke up and said that he would drive the moose away. The other animals laughed at the fly and said that such a small, weak animal could never defeat such a large and powerful moose. The fly, however, was confident that he would succeed. The next day, when the moose came to the river to drink, the fly bit him on the leg. The moose was annoyed by the pain and tried his best to get rid of the fly. But the fly continued to bite the moose all over his body. The moose ran around in circles trying to get rid of the fly, but the fly was much too small and quick for him. Eventually, the moose gave up and ran far away from the river. The other animals were surprised and overjoyed. They thanked the fly for his bravery. The fly told them all to remember that even the small can defeat the large and powerful if they are clever.

> 今日、私たちはアメリカ合衆国とカナダの大湖地域から来たイニシュナベグ人の伝統的なネイティブアメリカンの神話について語ることになります。この話は、「ハエが川を救った方法」というタイトルがつけられています。遥か昔、素晴らしい川があり、その川にはたくさんの魚が住んでいました。その水は清らかで澄んでいたので、多くの動物がここから飲むために遠くからやってきました。その評判の高さから、大きなヘラジカもこの素晴らしい川について知り、自分で見に行くことにしました。彼は失望することはありませんでした。実際、彼はその水をとても愛し、渇いた時にはいつでも近くで飲むことに決めました。しかし、残念ながら、このヘラジカはよく渇いたので、かなり頻繁に川から飲みました。彼がそんなにたくさん飲むので、水のレベルが下がり始めました。他の動物たちは、ヘラジカがこれほどたくさん、そして頻繁に飲み続けると何が起こるか心配し始めました。川の上に家を構えているビーバーは、もし水がなくなると、彼の家が壊れてしまうのではないかと恐れました。川から食べ物を得ているミンクは、川が自然に干上がると飢え死にしてしまうのではないかと心配しました。魚たちは最も怖がっていました。彼らは、川が干上がれば、陸の動物たちはどこか他の場所に移動すればいいだけですが、水がなくなれば彼らは死んでしまうと知っていました。すべての動物が集まって、何をすべきかを話し合いました。彼らは、ヘラジカを川から追い払わなければならないと知っていました。しかし、彼は彼らにとっては大きすぎて強力すぎるので、この任務を達成することはできませんでした。クマさえも彼を恐れていました。最終的に、ハエが話を切り出し、自分がヘラジカを追い払うと言いました。他の動物たちはハエを笑い、こんなに小さく弱い動物が、こんなに大きく強力なヘラジカを倒すことは決してできないだろうと言いました。しかし、ハエは自分が成功すると自信を持っていました。次の日、ヘラジカが飲むために川に来たとき、ハエは彼の足に噛みつきました。ヘラジカは痛みにイライラし、ハエを追い払おうと必死になりました。しかし、ハエはヘラジカの体中に噛みつき続けました。ヘラジカはハエを追い払うために円を描いて走り回りましたが、ハエは彼にとって小さすぎて素早すぎました。最終的に、ヘラジカはあきらめて、川から遠くに逃げました。他の動物たちは驚きと喜びを隠せませんでした。彼らはハエの勇敢さに感謝しました。ハエは彼ら全員に、もし彼らが賢ければ、小さなものでも大きく強力なものを倒すことができるということを覚えておくようにと言いました。
