    この物語は、アメリカ合衆国とカナダのグレートレイクス地域出身のナショナルバンク族の伝統的なネイティブアメリカンの神話であり、題名は「ハエが川を救った話」といいます。遥か昔、素晴らしい川がありました。その川にはたくさんの魚がいて、水も清潔でした。そのため多くの動物がこの素晴らしい川から水を飲みにやって来ました。彼は失望することはありませんでした。実際、彼は水をとても気に入り、いつでも喉が渇いたら近くに留まって飲むことに決めました。残念なことに、彼は頻繁に川から水を飲むため、他の動物たちは心配し始めました。川に家を建てていたビーバーは、水が消えたら彼の家が破壊されることを恐れていました。川から食べ物を得ていたヌートリアも、川が干上がったら飢えてしまうことを恐れていました。彼らは、川が干上がったら他の陸上動物たちはどこか別の場所に移動すればいいが、彼らは水がなくなったら死んでしまうと知っていました。
    すべての動物たちは、どうすればいいのかを話し合うために集まりました。彼らは、ムースを川から追い払わなければならないことを知っていましたが、彼はあまりにも大きくて強力で、彼らにはそれを達成することができませんでした。クマさえも彼を恐れていました。他の動物たちはハエを笑って、「そんなに小さくて弱い動物が、あんなに大きくて強力なムースに勝つなんてありえない」と言いました。しかし、ハエは自信を持って成功すると確信していました。
    翌日、ムースが川から水を飲むためにやって来たとき、ハエは彼の足をかんだのですが、ハエはムースの体中をかみ続けました。ムースはハエを追い払おうとして、周りを回って走り回りましたが、ハエはあまりにも小さくて速かったため、ムースからは逃げられませんでした。最終的に、ムースはあきらめて川から遠く離れて逃げました。他の動物たちは驚きと喜びでいっぱいでした。彼らはハエにその勇気に感謝しました。ハエは彼らに、小さなものでも賢ければ大きくて強力なものに勝つことができると覚えておくようにと言いました。
